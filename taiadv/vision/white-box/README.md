# Towards Million-Scale Adversarial Robustness Evaluation With Stronger Individual Attacks

ðŸ“„ **[Paper (arXiv 2411.15210)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15210)**

We propose a novel adversarial attack method, **Probability Margin Attack (PMA)**, based on the newly introduced **Probability Margin Loss**. Furthermore, we present **PMA+**, an enhanced version that combines diverse strategies for improved efficiency and performance.

To support large-scale, reproducible robustness evaluations, we provide a complete toolkit for attacking models on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **ImageNet**, and our newly released **CC1M** datasetâ€”a curated 1M-sample benchmark derived from CC3M.
