Code for Multimodal Jailbreak


The implementation of our multimodal jailbreak code is based on the work of [Visual-Adversarial-Examples-Jailbreak-Large-Language-Models
](https://github.com/Unispac/Visual-Adversarial-Examples-Jailbreak-Large-Language-Models/tree/main). Gratitude is extended to the original authors for their valuable contributions and commitment to open source.
